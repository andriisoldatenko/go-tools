# Tools for go

This is a catch-all repository to dump tools I've written for Go. It might or
might not continue to be filled and maintained in the future.

# redundantbranch

A `golang.org/x/tools/analysis` analyzer that finds break/continue/goto
statements that don't affect control flow. You can look into
[redundantbranch/testdata](redundantbranch/testdata) for examples of what that
means. There are sometimes reasons to have such redundancy - it can make it
easier to understand a large switch-statement and it can guard against future
modifications breaking code. So it should be treated as a lint-check and its
reports should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

You can install a standalone binary of this check using
```
go get github.com/Merovius/go-tools/cmd/redundantbranch`
```
